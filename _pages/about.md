## Hi, I'm Phil!

Welcome to my collection showcase. I go by many names in the collecting community - **Phil The Collector**, **Phil The Liquidator**, **Phil The Hoarder** - but you can just call me Phil.

## My Journey

I've been collecting since 2013, starting with just a few Funko Pops and Pokemon cards. What began as a casual hobby quickly evolved into a serious passion for preserving and curating pop culture memorabilia. Over the years, the collection has grown to encompass thousands of items across multiple categories.

## The Collector's Philosophy

My approach to collecting is simple: collect what you love, but also be smart about it. I'm not just a hoarder (despite one of my nicknames!) - I believe in:

- **Quality over quantity** - Each piece should have a story or significance
- **Strategic acquisitions** - Understanding market value and investment potential
- **Preservation** - Proper storage and care for long-term enjoyment
- **Community** - Sharing knowledge and connecting with fellow collectors
- **Balance** - Knowing when to buy, hold, and sell

## Why "Phil The Liquidator"?

While I love acquiring new pieces, I'm also not afraid to let items go. Part of being a smart collector is knowing when to downsize, upgrade, or pivot your focus. I've sold countless items over the years to fund grail purchases or simply to make room for new interests. The liquidator moniker comes from my ability to move inventory quickly and efficiently when needed.

## The Names Behind the Collection

### Future Gadget Labs
For fans of Steins;Gate, you'll recognize this name. It represents the experimental and eclectic side of my collection - the unique finds, the oddities, the "mad scientist" approach to collecting. These are the items that make people say "wait, you have THAT?"

### EVLution Collectibles
Evolution with a twist. This represents the maturation of my collecting journey - moving from impulse buys to calculated acquisitions, from quantity to quality. The "EVL" also plays on my gamer tag and online persona from my competitive gaming days.

## Beyond Collecting

When I'm not hunting for the next great addition to the collection, you might find me:

- Playing Magic: The Gathering at local game stores
- Building and displaying LEGO sets
- Watching anime (especially shows that inspire new collection categories)
- Researching market trends and investment opportunities
- Organizing and cataloging the collection (a never-ending task!)
- Sharing my knowledge with new collectors

## The Purpose of This Site

This website serves as both a digital catalog and a showcase. It helps me:

1. **Track my inventory** - Know exactly what I have and where it is
2. **Document purchases and sales** - Keep financial records organized
3. **Share my passion** - Connect with other collectors
4. **Preserve memories** - Each item has a story
5. **Plan strategically** - Identify gaps and opportunities

## Let's Connect

I'm always happy to talk about collecting, whether you're a seasoned veteran or just starting out. Have questions about an item in my collection? Interested in trading? Want advice on starting your own collection? Feel free to reach out!

Remember: **Every collection starts with a single item. The key is knowing which items to keep and which to let go.**
