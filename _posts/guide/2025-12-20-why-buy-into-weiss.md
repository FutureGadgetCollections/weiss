## Management Direction

Unlike Pokemon and Magic: The Gathering, Weiss Schwarz doesn't rely on their own in-house created IP. Instead, they take an MTG Universes Beyond or Fortnite approach where they partner with existing IPs for sets. The focus is usually on Anime IPs, and this strategy is beneficial for both parties:

- **For the IP holders:** The TCG has an existing player base, which is half the battle for getting people to engage with the product
- **For Weiss Schwarz:** They create collectible items off established, popular IPs with built-in fanbases

### Print-to-Demand Strategy

Weiss Schwarz tends not to crash and burn sets to the ground. They structure their printing plan by:
1. Taking pre-orders
2. Printing to cover pre-order demand
3. Adding a certain percentage above pre-order volume

This controlled printing approach helps maintain value and prevents market oversaturation.

## Set Design

The chase cards in Weiss Schwarz are typically special art versions of characters from the IP's show. These premium cards feature:

- High-quality special artwork of popular characters
- **Stamped signatures of the Japanese voice actors**

This unique feature creates significant collector appeal, as fans can own cards "signed" by the voices of their favorite characters. The combination of popular IP, special artwork, and voice actor signatures creates strong collector demand beyond just gameplay value.

## Gameplay & Investment Implications

### Eternal Format Structure

Unlike most other card games with rotating formats or living competitive lists, Weiss Schwarz is structured so that:
- Any card printed is legal
- There's always power creep in the game
- No cards rotate out of legality

### Value Creation Through Meta Shifts

From a value standpoint, this means an event outside of a product being out of print can dramatically increase the value of a set.

**Example scenario:**
1. An anime set sells moderately well on first release
2. The second set releases with a meta-competitive deck
3. The competitive deck requires cards that were only printed in the first set
4. This creates a spike in value for both the individual cards and sealed boxes from the first set
5. Competitive players need these cards, driving demand for the older product

This creates unique investment opportunities where older sets can appreciate significantly based on future releases, separate from traditional scarcity-based appreciation. The eternal format means cards from any set can become relevant and valuable at any time, creating long-tail value potential for sealed products.

## Key Takeaways

- **IP Partnership Model:** Reduces creative risk while leveraging established fanbases
- **Controlled Printing:** Print-to-demand strategy helps maintain value
- **Unique Collectibility:** Voice actor signatures create cross-market appeal
- **Eternal Format:** Creates ongoing demand for older products through meta shifts
- **Multiple Value Drivers:** Scarcity, gameplay relevance, and collector appeal all contribute to value
