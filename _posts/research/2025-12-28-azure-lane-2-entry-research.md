## Entry Research

### Market Analysis

The Azure Lane 2 set features numerous SP cards in the multi-hundred dollar range. For current singles prices and market data, refer to [Yuyu-Tei's marketplace](https://yuyu-tei.jp/sell/ws/s/azl2.0#release).

This pricing structure tells me that it'll be near impossible for a person to master set this collection without spending a significant amount of money chasing singles. The high-value signature cards create a strong incentive for collectors to either invest heavily or accept an incomplete set.

### Target Audience

Azure Lane is a gacha game, which means the fanbase is already familiar with and comfortable with gambling/gacha-style mechanics. I'd imagine anyone playing the game would love these gold signature cards featuring the voice actresses. This built-in audience of gacha enthusiasts creates a natural market for premium chase cards.

### Hindsight Assessment

Months after purchase, I've observed that there's more of this product available than any other set in my collection. The market seems to agree with my initial assessment.

The interesting dynamic here is that while the sellthrough rate is higher than expected, the supply is probably significantly higher as well. This creates a temporary abundance in the market.

**Long-term Outlook:**

Despite the current oversupply, I believe this product will age extremely well once game stores no longer have sealed boxes in stock. The combination of:
- Strong singles market with high-value chase cards
- Dedicated gacha game fanbase
- Voice actress signatures appealing to collectors

...suggests that once the initial supply is exhausted, this set will appreciate well over time.
