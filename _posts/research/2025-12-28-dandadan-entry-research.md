## Entry Research

Release Date: January 30, 2026

### Market Analysis

The Dandadan singles market shows interesting pricing dynamics. For current singles prices and market data, refer to [Yuyu-Tei's marketplace](https://yuyu-tei.jp/top/ws).

The SSP and SP cards are holding surprisingly strong value despite a notable absence: **there are no voice actress gold stamp signatures on these cards**. This is unusual for cards maintaining these price points.

Current pricing shows:
- SP cards: $20-$75 range
- Some SP cards and SSP cards reaching $300

The fact that these cards hold value without VA signatures is remarkable and suggests strong demand driven by other factors.

### Content Quality Assessment

In my opinion, Dandadan was the best anime of the season. The writer does an exceptional job with character development and storytelling. I expect Season 2 to be equally strong, which should sustain interest in the property.

### Visual Appeal

The SP cards look visually stunning. The artwork quality alone may be contributing to the sustained singles prices, compensating for the lack of signature chase cards.

### Investment Strategy

My approach will be: **Buy on release, and if it tanks, double up.**

### Long-term Speculation

There's an interesting dynamic to consider: If this set underperforms due to the lack of signatures, future Dandadan sets might require synergies from this first set. If that happens and sealed product becomes scarce, boxes could appreciate significantly as players and collectors scramble to complete their decks.

The combination of strong source material, excellent artwork, and potential future set synergies makes this a calculated risk worth taking.
