## Entry Research

### Market Analysis

The Frieren set features a few $300+ SSP chase cards, with the more common SP chase cards ranging between $20 to a few hundred dollars. For current singles prices and market data, refer to [Yuyu-Tei's marketplace](https://yuyu-tei.jp/sell/ws/s/sfn#release).

### Market Context

This is a reprint release. The original run was extremely successful, driven by the massive popularity of Anime Season 1. Frieren is widely regarded as the second-best anime of its season, having been released alongside another giant: Solo Leveling.

The fact that this set received a reprint demonstrates how significantly underanticipated the demand was for the initial release.

### Long-term Outlook

The writing of Frieren's story is exceptional, and I believe the set will continue to perform well as more seasons get released. The show's critical acclaim and strong fanbase suggest sustained interest in the property, which bodes well for the collectibility and value retention of this set.

The reprint status, while increasing short-term supply, validates the strength of the IP and suggests that this is a property Bushiroad expects to remain relevant long-term.
