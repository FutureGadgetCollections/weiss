## Entry Research

This was my entry purchase into Weiss Schwarz. I'm a fan of the anime show, and as a romance series, I anticipated strong value in the singles market.

### Market Analysis

When researching the set, I found that chase cards were priced between $20-$100, with approximately 3 signed cards per heroine at the SP rarity level. The SSP cards (master case hits) were valued at $200-$350.

For current singles prices and market data, refer to [Yuyu-Tei's marketplace](https://yuyu-tei.jp/sell/ws/s/mki#release).

### Hindsight Reflections

Writing this months after the purchase, there are a few things I'd do differently:

**Key Takeaway: I don't think buying Japanese sealed product was the right move.**

The English version is coming out soon, and I doubt the Japanese sealed products will be desirable until the English products dry up and become scarce. Even then, at the price point I paid, it's way too close to the price of an English booster box. The sellthrough rate will likely drop completely when:
- The anime season is over
- The English version is released

**What I'd Do Differently:**

If I were to approach this again, I would simply observe the Japanese market to gauge how well the product was engineered, and use that information to make a decision on the English version. If an English version never comes out, I'm fine with missing out on the opportunity.

This experience has taught me to be more strategic about which regional releases to invest in and to carefully consider the timing of English releases before committing to Japanese sealed product.
