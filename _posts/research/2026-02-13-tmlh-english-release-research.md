## English Release Research

Release Date: February 13, 2026

### Initial Assessment

Unlike my approach with Azure Lane 2 and Frieren, I don't think pre-ordering is the right play for this set. My speculation is that Too Many Losing Heroines won't perform particularly well in the English market.

### Singles Market Analysis

When examining the Japanese singles market, the value is rather lackluster:

The pricing structure doesn't suggest strong chase card demand that would drive sealed product value.

### Market Sentiment

From what I can observe, there doesn't seem to be much enthusiasm for pre-ordering this set. As a romcom where the main characters aren't overly sexualized, there isn't much to chase from a collector's perspective. This lack of provocative chase cards may limit the speculative appeal that drives demand for other sets.

### Investment Strategy

My plan is to take a measured approach:

1. **Initial Purchase**: Order one case from Alpha Investments
2. **Wait and See**: Monitor market performance for a few months
3. **Cost Averaging**: If the product tanks, order a second case to lower my cost basis

Despite the lukewarm market outlook, I'm still interested in acquiring this product because it's a great, underrated anime that I personally enjoy. The strategy balances my appreciation for the IP with realistic expectations about market performance.

This approach allows me to participate in the English release while minimizing risk and potentially capitalizing on any post-release price drops.
