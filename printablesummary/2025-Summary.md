## 4. Lessons Learned
1. The biggest loss was in the Japanese Too Many Losing Heroines. 
   2. I think it's best just to look at Japanese sets for assess hype and how well a set is engineered
   3. I'll most likely use that to determine if an english set is worth pre-ordering
   4. If it's not worth pre-ordering, I'll look at English released + a few months to see if it's being firesold
